# BoBot
Autonomous VEX robot using Robot C 

### Why does Bobot exist?
Bobot was created for the second engineering design course at UVIC. 
There was 3 milestones for the course that aligned with the progress in robot development:
  1. Mechanical Systems Demo
      - Demonstrate that robot can move efficiently.
      - Demonstrate cleaning action simulation by placing an object on top of the target.
  3. Electrical Systems Demo
      - Demonstrate that all sensors to be used in the robot function correctly and are correctly interfaced to the VEX microcontroller.
  5. Final Integrated Systems Demo
      - Integrate mechanical, structural, electrical and software systems.
      - Demonstrate that the robot performs tasks to required specification.
